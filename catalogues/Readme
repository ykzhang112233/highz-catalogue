This folder contains the .fits cataluges that used for the cross-matching.


## 1. Main catalogues

First I use Half Million Quasar (Flesch 2015,) to get quasar redshift, it include the following catalogues:
-  SDSS quasar catalogue till DR12 (Paris et al. 2017)	2017A&A...597A..79P

other high-z surveys after Flesch 2015 to check:
- Dark Energy hi-z, Reed S.L. et al., 2015MNRAS.454.3952R--OzDES:2017MNRAS.472..273C []
- DECaLS-UKIRT hi-z, Wang F. et al., 2017ApJ...839...27W (see citations) []
- SDSS overlap hi-z QSOs, Jiang L. et al.,2015AJ....149..188J(within Jiang 2016)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++cross-match radius++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
positional error of gleam is <20"
plus RMS ~5"... we use 25" radius to cross-match

+++++++++++++++++++other info.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
gleam synth beam 210-93",searching radius can be reduced to 105"(at most), and individual cases can be judged through catalogue PSF values.
Callingham used an angular cutoff of 2′20′′(70" in radius), which is approximately the FWHM of the MWA beam in the wideband image
nvss beam 45"
first 5.4" circle in north, 6.4*5.4" in mid, 6.8*5.4" south
only look for spectroscopic redshifts

The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is observing the entire sky north of -40° in the S-band (2-4GHz), with the highest angular resolution (2.5") of any all-sky radio continuum survey to date

steep spectrum bias: In sdss12 data, we found more than 3 galaxies without zsp or with zsp<1 within 30" of the gleam positions, so the optical counterparts may not be the high-z AGN but low-z galaxies which show steep spectrum in radio bands.

The searching was cross-matched with 30" but for checking multi-matched sources in a gleam position, should check with a radius related to the gleam beam sizes....

The multi-frequency data from literature are obtained from the following surveys or papers:
   1. nvss
   2. first
   3. TGSS
   4. vlss; vlssr
   5. SUMSS;SUMSSr
   5.5 CLASS+CRATES
   6. GB6
   7. PMN
